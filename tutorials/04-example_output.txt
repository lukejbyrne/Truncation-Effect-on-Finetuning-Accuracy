question: This field contains a text question that is likely part of a dataset designed for training or evaluating NLP models. In this case, the question is about the most popular Taylor Swift song among millennials and its cultural significance.
answer: This field provides the answer to the question mentioned above. It states that "Shake It Off" by Taylor Swift is the most popular among millennials due to its message of self-acceptance and individuality, which resonates with millennial values.
input_ids: These are numerical representations of the words or tokens in the input text (which could be the question, the answer, or both, depending on how the dataset is structured for training). Each number represents a specific word or token as understood by the model that will be trained or evaluated with this dataset. These IDs correspond to entries in a predefined vocabulary that the model uses to understand text.
attention_mask: This is a sequence of 1s and 0s used to differentiate actual content from padding in the input sequence. In sequences where the content does not fill the maximum sequence length, padding is added to ensure consistent input size across the dataset. The attention mask helps the model focus on the real content (marked with 1s) and ignore the padding (marked with 0s).
labels: Similar to input_ids, this field provides numerical representations of the words or tokens in the target text (the correct response the model should predict or generate). In training, labels are used to teach the model the correct output it should produce for a given input, allowing the model to learn from its errors by comparing its predictions to these labels.
